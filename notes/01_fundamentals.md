- Create Vite React project with typescript `npm create vite@latest hacker_stories_typescript -- --template react-ts`
- As a rule of thumb: If a variable does not need anything from within the function component’s body (e.g. parameters), then define it outside of the component which avoids re-defining it on every function call.
- Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React uses the camelCase naming convention. Which HTML does not.
- A React app has a component hierarch (or tree), with one root component which is typically `App`. A component can have zero, one or many child components.
- React components, also known as function components.
- Often block bodies will be necessary to introduce more business logic between function signature and return statement.
- React’s synthetic event is essentially a wrapper around the browser’s native event.
- In native HTML submitting a form triggers a page refresh. However, in React this page refresh should be prevented, because the developer should take care about what happens next.
- Always pass functions to these JSX event handlers, not the return value of the function.
- Props passed down should be treated as immutable data structure and not changed within the function component it is passed to.
- React state introduces a mutable data structure, i.e. stateful values.
- When a state gets mutated, the component with the state and all child components will re-render.
- When an (event) handler is passed as props from a parent component to its child component, it becomes a callback handler.
- React props are always passed down the component tree and therefore functions that are passed down as callback handlers in props can be used to communicate up the component tree.
- Knowing where to instantiate state in React is important. State should always be there where all components which depend on the state can read (via props) and update (via callback handler) it.
- HTML elements do not know the React state, so we need to sync the two by using the HTML `value` tag.
- Almost always use object destructuring for props in a function component’s function signature, because props are rarely used themselves.
- Use the spread operator when you want to pass all key/value pairs of an object to a child component in JSX.
- Use the rest operator when you only want to split out certain properties from your props object.
- Use nested destructuring only when it improves readability.
- useEffect is a hook in React that allows function components to perform side effects
- Use a custom key for local storage, this key can be shared across the app if using the same key
- Custom hooks are JavaScript functions that utilise React hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic in function components.
- `<React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment>` can be used to avoid a wrapping html tag. It's shorthand style is `<>...</>`.
- A Fragment is a way to group multiple React elements without introducing an additional DOM element.
- Default props value can be set by equating the props parameter in the const signature.
- A reusable component can have internal state by using a hook like useState.
- Essentially a React application is a bunch of React components arranged in the shape of a tree.
- Everything that’s passed between a component’s elements can be accessed as children in the component meaning you can pass in other html elements, providing more  flexibility with the component.
- “Children” in React refers to the content placed between the opening and closing tags of a component.
- React uses a declarative programming approach. Instead of manually manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) for UI updates, developers declare the desired UI state, and React manages the rendering process.
- useRef is a hook in React that provides a mutable object called a ref, which can hold a mutable value and persists across renders
- Using JavaScript’s bind method on a function allows us to bind arguments directly to that function that should be used when executing it.
- Inline handlers can be more difficult to debug because JavaScript logic may be hidden in JSX.
- If inline handlers need to use a block body, because there are more than one line of code executed, it’s about time to extract them as normal event handlers.
- Components are often rendered before initiating data fetching, and conditional rendering or placeholder content is used until the data arrives.
- useState allows components to manage state changes, including loading states and the updated data received asynchronously.
- In JavaScript, a true && 'Hello World' always evaluates to ‘Hello World’. A false && 'Hello World'always evaluates to false.
- Using expression && JSX is more concise than using expression ? JSX : null.
- Hooks must be used at the top level of a function component, not within conditions or loops.
